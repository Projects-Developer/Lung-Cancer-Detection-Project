### Abstract 

Lung Cancer detection at an earlier stage has become a very important and needy one for a human being. Early detection helps several patients with the best chance of recovery. Timely diagnosis and determination to the type of lung cancer has important clinical significance. The features which are used for the detection of Lung Cancer are collected from the Computed Tomography (CT scan) images. Machine Learning is an emerging technique that allows us to increase the accuracy of the result. In this project, we have implemented cancer detection using ML.
